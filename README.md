# üî® Modpack Upload Suite

# ‚ùì What is Modpack Upload Suite
Modpack Upload Suite is a Suite of Tools for Modpack Developers.

These tools can automate the process of uploading modpacks to CurseForge.
It creates a modpack manifest, which is then posted along with metadata to Curseforge for upload.
When the upload has been completed, server files are attached which are generated from the tool.

Additionally, this tool can fill the mods folder with mods from an exported instance, to make working through Git easier.

Almost everything can be toggled on/off in the settings.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Usage
1. Clone the project into your Modded Minecraft Instance.
2. Fill in the client.json and the settings.ps1.
4. Double-click the ModpackUploader script or start ModpackUploader.ps1 using the command line.
